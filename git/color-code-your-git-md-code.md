# Color code your git MD code

When adding code to your md files, the code initiator is "` ` `", without the spaces. You can brighten the day by adding the respective title for your
code to it, i.e. "` ` `javascript".

```
console.log("Hello world!");
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello brighter world!");
```
