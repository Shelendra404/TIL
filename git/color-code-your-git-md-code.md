# Color code your git MD code

When adding code to your md files, the code initiator is ``` gravis (`) x 3 . ``` You can brighten the day by adding the respective title for your
code to it, i.e. '''javascript (with proper gravis mark of course).

```
const text = "Hello world";
console.log(text);
```

```javascript
const text = "Hello world";
console.log("Hello brighter world!");
```
